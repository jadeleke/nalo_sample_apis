- **HTML Support**: Embed HTML content in the email body.
- **File Attachments**: Attach files to the emails.
- **Customizable Sender and Recipient**: Specify sender email, recipient email(s), and sender name.




### Payment API (Coming Soon)
- Details for the Payment API will be provided soon, including integration for initiating, tracking, and managing payments.

## Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or later.
- The `requests` library installed (`pip install requests`).
- Valid API credentials from Nalo Solutions.

### Installation
Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jadeleke/nalo_sample_apis.git
cd email-payment-api-client
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### Usage
### Sending Emails
Update the Python script to include your API key and correct file path for attachments.

Use the following Python code to send an email:

```bash
import requests

url = "http://email.nalosolutions.com/smsbackend/clientapi/Nal_resl/send-email/"

payload = {
    'key': 'your_key_here',
    'emailTo': 'recipient@example.com',
    'emailFrom': 'sender@example.com',
    'emailBody': """
    <html>
        <body>
            <h1>Welcome</h1>
            <p>This is a test email with HTML and attachment support.</p>
        </body>
    </html>
    """,
    'senderName': 'Your Name',
    'subject': 'Test Email with HTML and Attachment'
}
files = [
    ('attach_file', ('document.pdf', open('/path/to/document.pdf', 'rb'), 'application/pdf'))
]
headers = {}

response = requests.request("POST", url, headers=headers, data=payload, files=files)

print(response.text)
````


3. Replace the following values in the script:

your_key_here: Your API key from Nalo Solutions.

/path/to/document.pdf: Path to the file you want to attach.
